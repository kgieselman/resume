# Kyle Gieselman Resume

This repository holds my resume which was created using `Latex`. This language
was selected to allow my resume to be easily modified and version controlled.


## Generated PDF Resume

If you are looking for a generated pdf, look at the `releases`. The most recently
generated resume will be stored there.



## Developement Environment

Latex is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. I primarily use Ubuntu so the instructions below will help setup a debian based linux environment.

Install Latex
`sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra`

> Tested with more minimized installation, but they are missing required packages


Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/kgieselman/resume.git`

Build the PDF document
`cd resume`
`pdflatex resume_kyle_gieselman.tex`



## Todo Items

- [ ] Add Link to Github Profile
- [ ] Test working with template/structure files for latex
